# Project Name: Loyalty Score and Purchase Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior and loyalty scores using data from multiple sources. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and frequent pattern mining. The primary goal is to gain insights into user behavior, identify patterns, and classify users into different clusters based on their purchase habits and loyalty scores.

## Table of Contents

1. **Setup and Libraries**
   - Installation of necessary libraries.

2. **Data Reading and Preprocessing**
   - Reading data from CSV files.
   - Merging datasets.
   - Handling missing data.
   - Feature selection and engineering.

3. **Clustering with K-means**
   - Performing K-means clustering to classify users into different segments.
   - Evaluating the quality of clusters using Silhouette Coefficient.
   - Visualizing clusters using PCA.

4. **Frequent Pattern Mining**
   - Discovering frequently co-occurring transaction types.
   - Mining patterns for high and low-loyalty score users.
   - Association rule generation and interpretation.

5. **Findings**
   - Summarizing key findings from the analysis.
   - Providing insights into user behavior and transaction patterns within different clusters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Required libraries are mentioned at the beginning of the code.
- CSV files containing historical transaction data, merchant data, new merchant transaction data, and user score data.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using the provided code.

2. Run the code sections sequentially by following the comments and instructions.

3. Analyze the findings and insights in each section of the code.

4. Adapt the code to your specific dataset or customize it to explore different aspects of user behavior and loyalty scores.

## Conclusion

This project explores customer behavior and loyalty scores, clusters users based on their purchase patterns, and mines frequent transaction type patterns. The findings can be valuable for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
